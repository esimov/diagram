Diagram is a small CLI application to generate hand drawn diagrams from ASCII art.

![screencast](images/screencast.gif)

## Installation

In order to run the application please make sure that Go is installed on your local machine and check if `$GOPATH/bin` is included into the `PATH` directory.

Run the following commands to download the project and build the executable.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/esimov/diagram
$ cd diagram
$ go build

# Start the application
$ diagram
```

#### Build

A shell script is bundled into the library to mitigate the generation of binary files for the most common operating systems, but take care: different dependencies are needed for different operating systems (see the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section). 

To build the executable file run:

`$ make all`

## Usage

Once you are inside the terminal application you can create, edit or delete the ASCII diagrams. By pressing `CTRL+g` you can convert the ASCII art into a handwritten diagram. The generated `PNG` file will be saved into the `output` folder relative to the current path.

### Command Line support

The application also supports the generation of hand drawn diagrams directly from command line without to enter into the CLI application.

`$ diagram --help` will show the currently supported options:

```bash
┌┬┐┬┌─┐┌─┐┬─┐┌─┐┌┬┐
 │││├─┤│ ┬├┬┘├─┤│││
─┴┘┴┴ ┴└─┘┴└─┴ ┴┴ ┴
    Version: 1.0.6

CLI app to convert ASCII arts into hand drawn diagrams.

  -font string
    	Path to the font file (default "/Users/esimov/Projects/Go/src/github.com/esimov/diagram/font/gloriahallelujah.ttf")
  -in string
    	Source
  -out string
    	Destination
  -preview
    	Show the preview window (default true)
```

#### CLI Examples

Read input from `sample.txt` and write image to `sample.png` showing a preview window with the hand drawn diagram:

```bash
diagram -in sample.txt -out sample.png
```

Read input from `sample.txt` and write image to `sample.png`, and exit immediately without showing a preview window:

```bash
diagram -in sample.txt -out sample.png -preview=false
```

Generate diagram as above but use a font at a different location:

```bash
diagram -in sample.txt -out sample.png -preview=false -font /path/to/my/font/MyHandwriting.ttf
```
